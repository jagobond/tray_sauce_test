### Tray.io test

This includes a complete e2e test of the SauceLabs demo site.  It also includes what I managed to put together of the tray.io-based test before I was asked to stop due to Captcha issues (don't judge me too harshly on that one; I was never able to get to the refactoring/tidying phase)
#### Requirements:
- nodejs
- java runtime (for reporting)

#### To run
- clone the repo
- `npm install`
- `npm run test`

Enjoy
